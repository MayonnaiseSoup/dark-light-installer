# Prior installs

Git is required, you can find an install for it here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
If you're compiling from main.cpp, you will need a compiler.
I recommend the gcc compiler, which comes with a c++ compiler, you can download it here: https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html 



# How to use

If you're compiling from main.cpp:

1. Run `g++ -o installer main.cpp`
2. Run `./installer`


If you're running directly from the binary:

1. Run `./installer-for-macos-only`
